\section{ABSTRACT}
The abstract is a summary of your proposal. In general, your abstract should have enough information so that if I was to copy and paste your abstract into a web site, people would get the general idea of what your proposal is about. It should not go into any heavy detail, just the basics of what your project is about. The who, the what, and the why. You should keep your abstract to 200-400 words. Use this to ``hook in'' your reader.

As people, we will often require our own privacy. Either to simply relax, to be able to have our own thoughts or creative space, or to simply feel ‘safe’. Sometimes people try to breach this privacy, either because they are unaware, desperate, or malicious in their actions. Since the earliest of times the simple solution to prevent all of these from entering our safe space: A lock, or for smaller private items, a safe. Modern day safes can come in all shapes, sizes, and price ranges, with a variety of locking methods and tools. On a college campus, students are often in a new living situation, and their privacy may be challenged a lot more than is normal to them. However, to get a safe of the right dimensions and security, you must give up on the price, which isn’t exactly the most affordable for college students. Therefore, we are proposing the creation of a simply applied lock and safe that could be used in a college dorm setting. Something that could in theory be of any shape, size, and security for a reasonable price. It could be set to a simple combination lock, to a voice activated password, and more. Even if its simply used to keep a secret gift from your roommate or significant other, it would provide the security and privacy for each person’s needs.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
While the abstract and introduction may seem like it is similar, remember that your abstract should have enough information to stand on its own. The introduction is really the actual start to your proposal. Here you should introduce the project, the people involved and give a short introduction to the why you are doing this. This should be 1-3 paragraphs.

As you can tell, our project proposal is for a locking mechanism for a safe that would contain personal items, money, or really anything. This lock’s key would be a customizable series of numbers, color patterns, and words that could be customizable by the user. The size of said safe isn’t a real question, and the lock should be capable of working on various sized safes. 
Our team, Codebreakers, is composed of Andrew Novy, Tyler Chandler, Trey Miller, and led by Hannah Blumhoefer. We arrived at this proposal because as college students we all have thought about the security of our new home at one point or another, and this would be a way of addressing that for potentially all college students. At the same time, the intricacies of this lock are as much as we can manage, letting our creativity challenge our ability in order to produce the best possible product.


\section{FEATURES}
Your Features section must include a listing of at least three key features that makes your project unique. Each item needs to be backed up with a description of what it will do and why. A listing of just three items is not enough, you need to describe what those features are and why your group feels they are needed. For that reason your features should have a paragraph for each key item that describes what that key feature is. A key feature should be something that is significant to your project. For example, a key feature an autopilot system is the ability to be able to set an altitude and the autopilot will automatically set the airspeed. That is a significant feature that has a large impact on that system.

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
Here you will go into more detail on what problem you hope to solve or address.  You should discuss what the problem is and why it is important to solve it. In this section, you need to be clear on what the problem is, so do not think of this as a ``light'' section. It helps to define your project.

Your team needs to do some research into the problem at hand. Becuase of that, you should have around two to three references that you are pulling from. There are lots of places you can find references from including the ISU library and Google Scholar. I would also suggest looking at Adafruit's website, as you may find inspiration or looking to improve something already there. Remember to cite your sources though. If you find something online, that can often be citation.

When you create your ``ref.bib'' file, don't forget to follow the standards for a BiBTex file. Certain things like webistes requires certain keywords for it to render properly. There are lots of sources online to help with this and many places like the ISU Library and Google Scholar can also generate text that is compatible with a BiBTex file. Once you have your Bib file ready, don't forget to cite your citations in your proposal like this \cite{einstein} or this \cite{dirac}.

\section{PROBLEM SOLUTION}

Since the main problem faced is an anti-theft system that fits the needs and budget of a college student, a small system that fits these nessecities is needed. Our solution to this problem is to design and build an anti-theft system to fulfill this need. This solution will consist of building, designing, coding, and testing a vault-type structure and corresponding anti-theft system that is compact enough to fit into a college dorm room while also providing enough room to fit several personal items and being economically feasible for students.
In order to arrive at our solution, we first approached our problem by brainstorming potential lock, vault, or anti-theft systems and the application of said system. Through this deliberation, we decided that a small vault-like system would make the most sense for the needs of a college student. After determining the application of our solution, we began the design process of how the system would work and a rough plan of how the setup would look.
As mentioned above in the features section, our anti-theft system will consist of several mechanisms, sensors, and features to achieve out solution. First, a keyword will be spoken into the Circuit Playground Express microphone to allow for access to the next steps of opening the vault. A button combination will then be needed in order to unlock the vault door while, simaltaneously, a correct color idenification must be detected by the color sensor. If the correct sequence and color are present, this will activate two servos that will let the door be opened, giving access to contents inside. In addition to this, the Circuit Playground Express will be used to monitor whether or not the correct information was entered. If the incorrect information is given, an alarm will be activated to alert when someone is trying to break into the vault.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{cpx01.jpg}
\caption{Anti-Theft System Design}
\label{fig:Prop1}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Prop1}, the general layout of the components will have the Circuit Playground Express located in the middle of the vault door. Since the Express provides feed back, accepts vocal and visual inputs, and needs to be in close proximity to external sensors, this is the most logical placement. The combination buttons will be located underneath the Express also for easy access to the user. The second image in Figure \ref{fig:Prop1} shows the configuration of the vault door with the servo actuators located in the side of the door compared to the locations of the Express and buttons. Finally, in the last Figure \ref{fig:Prop1} image, the inside of the vault will have two spaces to store personal items with a removable shelf for larger items. Although the final product would be constructed out of metal, for ease this prototype will be constructed out of wood.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \caption{Parts Requested}
  \label{table:parts_list}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|p{3in}|c|}
  
  \hline
  Part description & Qty\\

  \hline
  Hinges & 2\\
  \hline
  Wood & Vault Materials\\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \end{table}
As shown above in Table \ref{table:parts_list}, this is the list of parts we are requesting to complete our solution to the anti-theft system problem. Although this should cover the extra sensors and technology we need, this can still be regarded as a pelimenary list. Altough the exact about of wood needed at this time is unknown, vault building materials are added to the table to indicate the request for these materials.

Finally, you can also include any pseudo code or any code snippets you have gathered so far.  This is not required, but if you found some starter code or came up with some ideas for the code, put it here. If you want to embed code into \LaTeX, you can use the example below on how to do this in \LaTeX.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Arduino]
#include <Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h>

void setup() {
  CircuitPlayground.begin();
}

void loop() {
  CircuitPlayground.clearPixels();

  delay(500);

  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(0, 255,   0,   0);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(1, 128, 128,   0);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(2,   0, 255,   0);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(3,   0, 128, 128);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(4,   0,   0, 255);
  
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(5, 0xFF0000);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(6, 0x808000);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(7, 0x00FF00);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(8, 0x008080);
  CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(9, 0x0000FF);
 
  delay(5000);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{CONCLUSION}
Finally, wrap up your proposal. This only needs to be one or two paragraphs, but it should conclude with what you plan to do and the why and how. Yes, this may seem repetitive, but that is intentional. Do not forget to update your references as those will appear below in a seperate page.
